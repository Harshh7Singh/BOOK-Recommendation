# BOOK-Recommendation
"This project builds a Book Recommendation System using content-based filtering (TF-IDF &amp; cosine similarity), collaborative filtering (KNN &amp; SVD), and clustering (KMeans) on book metadata and ratings data. It helps users discover books similar to their interests by analyzing text features and rating behavior."
